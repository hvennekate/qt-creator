    \title Editing 3D Assets in Design Mode

    \QDS opens QML files that contain 3D scenes in the Design mode and the
    scenes in the 3D editor. You can add imported 3D assets
    to projects and edit them to create scenes and states, as well as the
    transitions between them.

    \image studio-editing-3d-scenes.png "3D assets in Design mode"

    To edit 3D scenes in the Design mode:

    \list
        \li \uicontrol {3D Editor} (1) is the working area where you create the
            scene, position the model, light and camera, as well as move and
            scale items.
        \li \uicontrol {3D View} (2) is where you see the scene projected by the
            camera.
        \li The sidebars contain views where you can select QML types to use in
            the scene, specify properties for them, and view them in a tree
            structure, as well as to create connections and browse projects and
            files. You can select the content of the sidebars in the sidebar
            menu:
        \list
            \li \uicontrol {Library} (3) displays the building blocks that you
                can use to create scenes: predefined Qt Quick 3D Components,
                Qt Quick Controls, your own 3D assets that you import to the
                project, and other assets. For more information, see
                \l {Adding 3D Views}.
            \li \uicontrol {Navigator} (4) displays the items in the current QML
                file as a tree structure. For more information, see
                \l {Managing Item Hierarchy}.
            \li \uicontrol {Properties} (5) organizes the properties of the
                selected item. You can change the properties also in the
                \uicontrol {Text Editor}. For more information, see
                \l {Specifying Item Properties}.
            \li \uicontrol Connections enables you to create connections
                between objects, signals, and object properties. For more
                information, see \l{Adding Connections}.
            \li \uicontrol {File System} shows all files in the currently
                selected directory. For more information, see
                \l{Viewing the File System}.
            \li \uicontrol {Open Documents} shows currently open files.
            \li \uicontrol {Projects} shows a list of projects open in the
                current session. For more information, see
                \l{Viewing Project Files}.
        \endlist
        \li \uicontrol {States} displays the different states of the
            item. QML states typically describe user interface configurations,
            such as the UI controls, their properties and behavior and the
            available actions. For more information, see \l{Adding States}.
        \li \uicontrol Timeline (6) provides a timeline and keyframe based
            editor that enables you to animate the properties of components.
    \endlist

    To close the 3D editor, select \uicontrol 2D in the list on the toolbar (7).
    To reopen it, select \uicontrol {2D/3D}.
