    \title Adding 3D Views

    To add a 3D view to the scene, drag and drop a \uicontrol {View 3D}
    component from \uicontrol Library > \uicontrol {QML Types} >
    \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D} to the 3D editor or to the \uicontrol Navigator.
    A 3D view contains a reference node that specifies a scene light, camera,
    and model. A default material is attached to the model. You can attach
    textures to materials.

    By default, a directional light and a perspective camera are used.
    To use other light and camera types, change the type of the component in
    the \uicontrol Type field in the \uicontrol Properties view. For example,
    to use a point light, enter \e {PointLight}.

    To edit component properties, select the component in the 3D editor
    or in the \uicontrol Navigator and modify the property values in the
    \uicontrol Properties view.

    For more information about the available components and their properties,
    see \l{Using 3D Components}.
